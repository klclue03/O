                    This game has many different possible outcomes. If you want to see which move beats which,
                    observe the table below:
                    <img src="https://i0.wp.com/cjleo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/rps15_lovelace.jpg?resize=658%2C668&ssl=1"

                    However, there are several possible twists that could occur:
                    <br>
                    <li>There is a very small chance that sponge beats anything.</li>
                    <li>There is a chance that the gun does not have any ammo and therefore cannot win.</li>
                    <li>There is the chance that the tree is fire resistant and is immune to fire, but it cannot beat 
                        fire.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a small chance that it could be raining, and so water beats air.</li>
                    <li>With the dragon and snake interaction, there is a chance that the snake could evolve and tie with 
                        the dragon.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a 50% chance that it is not thundering, so lightning loses and would actually take a point away from the user.
                         However, if lightning wins, the user gains two points.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a small chance that that winning the wolf vs. devil fight grants the user 1000 points,
                        but also a small chance losing would deduct 1000 points from the user.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is a 0.01% chance that the computer could win no matter what.</li>
                    <li>If the user chooses human, if the technology level is above 25 out of 27, it could prevent the computer 
                        from winning a point.
                    </li>
                    <li>There is an extremely small chance that in any scenario the user wins the lottery and collects 1000 points.</li>
                    <br>
                    These twists will help this already interesting game of rock, paper, scissors become more engaging and risky. Have fun!
