# Overly Complicated Rock Paper Scissors

**Ever wondered if you could make the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors more complex and interesting? This web application creates an alternative version of Rock, Paper, Scissors with 15 different moves. Play against a computer and compete for a true test of skill and definitely not luck.**

## How To Play
This game has hundreds of different possible outcomes and combinations. To get a better idea of which move beats which, refer to the diagram below:

**On top of this, there are several different, but mostly low chance twists that could occur:**
<li>There is a very small chance that sponge beats anything.</li>
<li>There is a chance that the gun does not have any ammo and therefore cannot win.</li>
<li>There is the chance that the tree is fire resistant and is immune to fire, but it cannot beat 
    fire.
</li>
<li>There is a small chance that it could be raining, and so water beats air.</li>
<li>With the dragon and snake interaction, there is a chance that the snake could evolve and tie with 
    the dragon.
</li>
<li>There is a 50% chance that it is not thundering, so lightning loses and would actually take a point away from the user.
     However, if lightning wins, the user gains two points.
</li>
<li>There is a small chance that that winning the wolf vs. devil fight grants the user 1000 points,
    but also a small chance losing would deduct 1000 points from the user.
</li>
<li>There is a 0.01% chance that the computer could win no matter what.</li>
<li>If the user chooses human, if the technology level is above 25 out of 27, it could prevent the computer 
    from winning a point.
</li>
<li>There is an extremely small chance that in any scenario the user wins the lottery and collects 1000 points.</li>
